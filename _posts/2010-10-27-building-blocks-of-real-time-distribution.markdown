# Building Blocks of Real-Time Distribution

Back in July, I gave a talk about the ["Building Blocks of Real-Time
Distribution"](http://github.com/downloads/mojodna/mojodna.github.com/Building%20Blocks%20of%20Real-Time%20Distribution.pdf)
at the [GeoWeb 2010](http://geowebconference.org/) conference in Vancouver, BC.
It was pretty heavy on the buzzwords and the name dropping, so I created [an
accompanying page](http://mojodna.net/gw2010/) with links and
definitions/background in order to make the slides a bit more coherent. The PDF
itself also has a rough transcript of what I said in the talk, so that should
help too.

In the talk, I attempted to cover the considerations and technology choices
when implementing real-time services in various environments with different
types of data. The talk focused on spatial data, but I think it remains
relevant, with the exception of one or two slides.

I continue to pitch XMPP because I still think it's a good, if
over-complicated, solution. Presence tracking and the ability to run ephemeral
clients are seriously awesome features. However, the real momentum these days
seems to be behind streaming HTTP APIs and PubSubHubbub. Julien and
[SuperFeedr](http://superfeedr.com/) have done a great job adapting to the
changing landscape and shipping awesome features, so definitely check them out.

That is all.
