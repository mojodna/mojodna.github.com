# make For Data Using Makefiles

[Mr. Mather](http://smathermather.wordpress.com/) recently spotted the
[`Makefile`](https://github.com/stamen/toner-carto/blob/master/Makefile) we've
been using for the [updated version of
Toner](http://content.stamen.com/new_knight_grant_new_toner_new_infrastructure)
and asked for a walk-through.

Like many other people who wrangle data for a living, I've been in on-and-off
pursuit of a `make`-like approach to processing and transforming data.
Specifically, one that allows me to idempotently bootstrap and process data
without starting from zero each time. Also, one that makes it easy enough to
script experiments pro-actively rather than putting replicability off.

## Common Idioms

We use a number of `sh` / `bash` idioms that are helpful to recognize as such.

### Use of Exit Codes

When a process exits, it does so with a numeric code that indicates success or
failure (in the latter case, often with a value that can be used to determine
why). `0` is considered success; anything else is a failure of some sort.
These codes aren't directly visible, but `make` uses them to determine whether
a target was successful (and whether execution should continue). `$?` can be
used to surface the code in a shell context:

```bash
$ echo hi; echo $?
hi
0
```

There are a few cases where we want to shield `make` from failures (to prevent
execution from stopping). For example:

```bash
carto -l $< > $@ || (rm -f $@; false)
```

This runs `carto`; if it fails, it deletes the output (`$@`).  However, if
there was no output, `rm` will return successfully, but the task actually
failed. To work-around that, we execute `rm` in a subshell (using parentheses)
and explicitly return false (`false`) so that `make` ceases execution.

### `||` and `&&`

`||` and `&&` are used in conjunction with exit codes to conditionally execute
subsequent parts of a composite command. `||` is used when you want to execute
a command only if the first returns an error (non-zero exit code); `&&` when
you want to execute a command only if the first was successful.

### `> /dev/null 2>&1`

POSIX processes are provided 3 file descriptions (handles to files or file-like
things) by default.  `stdin` (content from a file or other source like
a keyboard) is file descriptor `0`, `stdout` is `1`, and `stderr` is `2`. Thus,
`echo hi > /dev/null 2>&1` says to redirect `stdout` (the default output) to
`/dev/null` (into the abyss) and then `stderr` (`2`) to the same place as
`stdout` (as a reference: `&1`). In this context, we use this to squelch
output, since we generally just care about the exit code (either directly, or
after `grep`ing through it or counting lines (`wc -l`)).

### `psql` Checks

At various points, we want to short-circuit tasks if a resource already exists.
In a traditional `Makefile`, these resources would be files and that
short-circuiting is built-in. However, since we're since working with database
tables (etc.) and there are no file equivalents, we need to implement
equivalent functionality.

We use `psql -c` for practically all existence checks, as it allows us to
construct a SQL command and use it to query PostgreSQL. Unfortunately,
different checks result in varying output and exit codes.

#### Looking for Relations

`\d <relation>` will check for the existence of a "relation" (which could be
a table, view, etc.). It displays the name, type, and owner of the relation and
exits with `0` only if it matched something.

#### Looking for Extensions

`\dx <extension>` will check for extensions matching the provided name. If
present, it will display various information about it. Unfortunately, it exits
with `0` regardless of whether anything has been found or not, so we need to
`grep` the output for the presence of the name.

#### Looking for Functions

`\df <name>` will check for functions matching the provided name. When
a function has multiple signatures, it will be displayed multiple times. Like
`\dx`, it exits with `0` no matter what, so we need to `grep`
(case-insensitively) for the function we're looking for.

### Implicit `make` Variables

`make` includes many [implicit
variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Implicit-Variables.html),
most of which are intended for use in an environment where source files are
being compiled and linked into binaries. However, there are still a few we make
use of:

* `$@` - the name of the target (the thing before the `:`).
* `$<` - the name of the first prerequisite. Convenient.
* `$^` - all prerequisites, space-delimited. Can be combined with
  `$(word <n>,$^`) to select the _n_th one.

### `make` Functions

Since many of the targets we're working with are synthetic, we need to extract
relevant components of their names. Database-related functionality is grouped
under the `db/` "path", so we primarily use
[`subst`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Text-Functions.html)
to remove irrelevant components. We also use `word` to refer to components
within space-delimited values.

### `make` Patterns

There are many resources that follow patterns when we work with data. Natural
Earth's filenames and source URLs are a good example of this. In keeping with
the DRY principle ("don't repeat yourself"), we fold these into a smaller
number of targets using `make` patterns. These are strings that include `%`
anywhere text may vary.

The convenient bit is that prerequisites can also use the `%` syntax and the
value of the pattern in the target name will be substituted. Thus, `%: %.mml`
will convert `toner` to `toner: toner.mml` and gives us the behavior we're
looking for.

## Annotated `Makefile`

Without further ado, here's an annotated snapshot of the `Makefile`-driven
approach we've been using. Suggestions are most welcome, especially if they
simplify or clarify.

```Makefile
SHELL := /bin/bash
```

_Use `bash` for sub-shells, allowing use of `bash`-specific functionality._

```Makefile
PATH := $(PATH):node_modules/.bin
```

_Add `npm`-installed binaries to the `PATH`._

```Makefile
define EXPAND_EXPORTS
export $(word 1, $(subst =, , $(1))) := $(word 2, $(subst =, , $(1)))
endef
```

_Define a macro that expands (splits on `=`) and exports (makes available to
sub-shells) key-value arguments, e.g. `DATABASE_URL=postgres:///db`._

```Makefile
# wrap Makefile body with a check for pgexplode
ifeq ($(shell test -f node_modules/.bin/pgexplode; echo $$?), 0)
```

_Check whether `pgexplode` has been installed (it's effectively a prerequisite
for the entire `Makefile`); `test` doesn't output anything, so the return code
(`$?`) needs to be `echo`'d for comparison with `0` (and escaped with an extra
`$` to be passed through to the `shell` call)._

```Makefile
# load .env
$(foreach a,$(shell cat .env 2> /dev/null),$(eval $(call EXPAND_EXPORTS,$(a))))
```

_Read `.env` (squelching error messages if one doesn't exist) and pass each
environment pair to `EXPAND_EXPORTS` to make it available to commands in
targets._

```Makefile
# expand PG* environment vars
$(foreach a,$(shell set -a && source .env 2> /dev/null; node_modules/.bin/pgexplode),$(eval $(call EXPAND_EXPORTS,$(a))))
```

_Use `pgexplode` to expand `DATABASE_URL` into [`libpq`-compatible environment
variables](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/libpq-envars.html). This
will read from the environment (`$DATABASE_URL`) if one isn't present in
`.env` (or `.env` doesn't exist)._

```Makefile
define create_relation
@psql -c "\d $(subst db/,,$@)" > /dev/null 2>&1 || \
        psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -qX1f sql/$(subst db/,,$@).sql
endef

define create_extension
@psql -c "\dx $(subst db/,,$@)" | grep $(subst db/,,$@) > /dev/null 2>&1 || \
        psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -qX1c "CREATE EXTENSION $(subst db/,,$@)"
endef
```

_Macro definitions that will strip `db/` from targets' `$@` (target name) and
use it as the name of a SQL file or PostgreSQL extension (`$(subst db/,,$@)`).
The first command (`psql -c "\d $(subst db/,,$@)" > /dev/null 2>&1`) checks for
the presence of a relation in the database specified by `DATABASE\_URL` and
only evaluates SQL commands if it fails. `\d <name>` checks for the presence of
a relation of any kind, `\dx` for loaded extensions, etc._

_`ON_ERROR_STOP=1` is used to abort as soon as an error occurs, `-q` is
"quiet", `-X` ignores any `psqlrc` files, `-1` runs the command in a single
transaction, `-f` provides a file containing commands, and `-c` tells it to use
the provided command._

_Commands are prefixed with `@` to prevent `make` from printing them (since
they're unnecessarily complicated due to the need to check for the existence of
non-file resources)._

```Makefile
define register_function_target
.PHONY: db/functions/$(strip $(1))

db/functions/$(strip $(1)): db
        @psql -c "\df $(1)" | grep -i $(1) > /dev/null 2>&1 || \
                psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -qX1f sql/functions/$(1).sql
endef

$(foreach fn,$(shell ls sql/functions/ 2> /dev/null | sed 's/\..*//'),$(eval $(call register_function_target,$(fn))))
```

_Generate targets for each file in `sql/functions`, callable as
`db/function/<name>` and depending on the `db` target (keep reading)._

```Makefile
# Import PBF ($2) as $1
define import
.PHONY: db/osm-$(strip $(word 1, $(subst :, ,$(1)))) db/$(strip $(word 1, $(subst :, ,$(1))))

db/$(strip $(word 1, $(subst :, ,$(1)))): db/osm-$(strip $(word 1, $(subst :, ,$(1)))) db/shared

db/osm-$(strip $(word 1, $(subst :, ,$(1)))): db/postgis db/hstore $(strip $(word 2, $(subst :, ,$(1))))
        @psql -c "\d osm_roads" > /dev/null 2>&1 || \
        imposm3 import \
                --cachedir cache \
                -mapping=imposm3_mapping.json \
                -read $(strip $(word 2, $(subst :, ,$(1)))) \
                -connection="$${DATABASE_URL}" \
                -write \
                -deployproduction \
                -overwritecache
endef
```

_Macro definition for importing OSM extracts. When called, it generates targets
like `db/<place>` (which depends on both the import and `db/shared` (see
below)) and `db/osm-<place>`, which does the actual import. `osm_roads` is
assumed to be created by `imposm3` in this case. `$${DATABASE_URL}` is escaped
because this is a macro (so it's evaluated at runtime) and uses braces to use
the environment variable._

Now begins what looks like a more conventional `Makefile`.

```Makefile
# default target
default: toner

# symlink into TileMill's project folder (if TM is installed)
link:
        @test -e ${HOME}/Documents/MapBox/project && \
                test -e ${HOME}/Documents/MapBox/project/toner || \
                ln -sf "`pwd`" ${HOME}/Documents/MapBox/project/toner

# clean up derivative files
clean:
        @rm -f *.mml *.xml

# create a default .env file with a sensible(?) default
.env:
        @echo DATABASE_URL=postgres:///toner > $@
```

```Makefile
%: %.mml
        @cp $< project.mml
```

_A pattern, which obviates the need to declare multiple redundant targets. If
`make toner` is run, it will depend on `toner.mml` (see below) and will
silently copy the output (`$<` is the expanded name of the first dependency) to
`project.mml` for TileMill to read._

```Makefile
mml: $(subst .yml,.mml,$(filter-out circle.yml,$(wildcard *.yml)))

xml: $(subst .yml,.xml,$(filter-out circle.yml,$(wildcard *.yml)))
```

_Defines targets that will make MML and XML files corresponding to all `.yml`
files **except** `circle.yml` (which is a control file for
[CircleCI](https://circleci.com), not a style)._

```Makefile
.PRECIOUS: %.mml

%.mml: %.yml map.mss labels.mss %.mss interp js-yaml
        @echo Building $@
        @cat $< | interp | js-yaml > tmp.mml && mv tmp.mml $@
```

_Builds `*.mml` by interpolating environment variables into
a [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/)-templated YAML file
([`interp`](https://github.com/stamen/interp)) and converting to JSON
([`js-yaml`](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml)). `tmp.mml` is used so that
`mv` can atomically move the file into place (without doing this, TileMill
periodically chokes when reading partially-written files)._

_This depends on `<style>.yml`, `map.mss`, `labels.mss`, and `<style.mss>` so
that it will be considered stale when any of those are modified. `interp` and
`js-yaml` are explicitly called out as dependencies so that they can be
installed if necessary (see below)._

_This is marked as `.PRECIOUS` so that artifacts won't be deleted when called
as an intermediate target (i.e. from an XML target)._

```Makefile
.PRECIOUS: %.xml

%.xml: %.mml carto
        @echo
        @echo Building $@
        @echo
        @carto -l $< > $@ || (rm -f $@; false)
```

_Builds `*.xml` from `<style>.mml` (declared above). `|| (rm -f $@; false)` is
included because `carto` may leave behind invalid XML files when it fails (and
because we want to pass the failure through and terminate the current `make`
invocation._

```Makefile
.PHONY: carto

carto: node_modules/carto/package.json

.PHONY: interp

interp: node_modules/interp/package.json

.PHONY: js-yaml

js-yaml: node_modules/js-yaml/package.json

node_modules/carto/package.json: PKG = $(word 2,$(subst /, ,$@))
node_modules/carto/package.json: node_modules/millstone/package.json
        @type node > /dev/null 2>&1 || (echo "Please install Node.js" && false)
        @echo "Installing $(PKG)"
        @npm install $(PKG)

node_modules/interp/package.json: PKG = $(word 2,$(subst /, ,$@))
node_modules/interp/package.json:
        @type node > /dev/null 2>&1 || (echo "Please install Node.js" && false)
        @echo "Installing $(PKG)"
        @npm install $(PKG)

node_modules/js-yaml/package.json: PKG = $(word 2,$(subst /, ,$@))
node_modules/js-yaml/package.json:
        @type node > /dev/null 2>&1 || (echo "Please install Node.js" && false)
        @echo "Installing $(PKG)"
        @npm install $(PKG)

node_modules/millstone/package.json: PKG = $(word 2,$(subst /, ,$@))
node_modules/millstone/package.json:
        @type node > /dev/null 2>&1 || (echo "Please install Node.js" && false)
        @echo "Installing $(PKG)"
        @npm install $(PKG)
```

_Artificial (`.PHONY`) targets for required commands along with file-based
dependencies and checks for Node. `PKG` is defined as a `make` variable in
preparation for future refactoring that turns this boilerplate into a macro._

_`package.json` declares dependencies on these commands, but it also includes
everything else to run a rendering node, so this is a lower-impact way of
ensuring that they're installed._

```Makefile
.PHONY: DATABASE_URL

DATABASE_URL:
        @test "${$@}" || (echo "$@ is undefined" && false)
```

_A target definition that can be used when one wants to ensure that
a `DATABASE_URL` was provided._

```Makefile
.PHONY: db

db: DATABASE_URL
        @psql -c "SELECT 1" > /dev/null 2>&1 || \
        createdb
```

_Target to ensure that a database exists. If `psql` returns fall, `createdb`
will be run (using `libpq` environment variables extracted from
`DATABASE\_URL`) to create one._

```Makefile
.PHONY: db/postgis

db/postgis: db
        $(call create_extension)

.PHONY: db/hstore

db/hstore: db
        $(call create_extension)
```

_Targets that create extensions (and require that a database exists) using the
macros defined above._

```Makefile
.PHONY: db/shared

db/shared: db/postgres db/shapefiles

.PHONY: db/postgres

db/postgres: db/functions/highroad
```

_Meta-targets that depend on both explicit (`db/shapefiles`) and implicit
(`db/functions/highroad`) targets._

```Makefile

_Macro definition that creates `db/ne_<whatever>` and `shp/natural_earth/*`
targets for [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/) sources. It
assumes that it's called with arguments in the form `<name>:<source
file>:[shapefile]`. (If someone can help simplify the repeated `$(strip $(word
1, $(subst :, ,$(1))))` declarations (used to extract the first component), I'd
appreciate it!)_

_The `db/<whatever>` target runs `ogr2ogr` with a set of options that we've
found to work well with the Natural Earth Shapefiles over the years._

_`shp/natural_earth/*-merc.{shp,dbf,prj,shx}` states that there will be
4 artifacts for each invocation of `ogr2ogr` (used to reproject here). Again,
we use options gathered over the years along with `/vsizip` to avoid needing to
unzip. If a single "file" (base name, really) exists in the zip, just the name
of the zip file is necessary, otherwise a path to the Shapefile within the zip
is necessary (the list of layers below takes advantage of that by allowing
`[shapefile]` to be optional. (This is necessary due to errors in the packaging
of some of the Natural Earth layers.)_

_Aggressive escaping is necessary in order for literal `$`s to be passed
through, e.g. `$$$$(dirname $$@)`._

_The `shp/natural_earth/*-merc.zip` target uses `$^` for the list of files to
compress, which contains the expanded names of all of the dependencies. `zip`'s
`-j` option is used to "junk paths" and put everything in the root of the zip
file._

_Define a list of Natural Earth layers along with their local file references
and (optional) Shapefile names and call `natural_earth` to generate targets. As
with the OSM extracts, patterns are used to match the conventions used by the
Natural Earth site._
