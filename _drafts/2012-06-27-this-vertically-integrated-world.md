# This Vertically Integrated World

I don't like this vertical integration trend.

There, I've said it.  I've been happily ensconced in Apple's closed ecosystem for years now, but it's only been with the recent, heavy promotion of Google Play and the recent Windows Phone announcements that it's really started bothering me.

It could be the cost of DRM-laden media files that don't transfer well between devices, but that seems to be mostly solved.  It could be the diversity of eBook formats and the lack of common support across multiple device operating systems.

It's not.  It's the apps.  I've probably spent $100 in the App Store.  That's probably an underestimate.  It means that I'm incentivized to continue using Apple phones.  It would be nice to try something different (I had a Nexus One for a while and Windows Phone appeals), but my investment in iOS apps is lost if I do (yeah, yeah, sunk costs and all, but bear with me).  Furthermore, I'm a slave to my Verizon contract--if I want to switch (at a subsidized price; perhaps I shouldn't complain), I'm committed to my experiment for 2 years.

It's getting worse.  My address book has long been scattered by the divide between Gmail and iCloud and the service-device-OS integration is intensifying, forcing me to make choices.  And they're not just piecemeal choices like they've been in the past--if I choose one set of services, others are forced on me and I miss out on the opportunity if a service from another silo is best of breed in a different category.

It can be argued that this has long been true--do you Yahoo!?--but I'd say that the incorporation of social networks into these silos (combined with the dominance of Facebook and massive promotion of Google+) has turned it into a decision with wide-ranging side-effects.

Some of this could be avoided.  I don't really find that search results that worked for my friends showing up for me really make my experience better.  I don't need to watch movies while I'm waiting in line at the post office.  And I really like paperback books.  I can give them to friends and interact with them face-to-face in the process.
